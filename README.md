# Installation

### Before You Begin!

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

## Install

The installation takes around 5 min. It all depends on the hardware and internet
speed you are have.

## Start the development server

# Configuration

## Font Awesome 5

import faFacebook from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free-brands/faFacebook'

fontawesome.library.add(faCogs, faEdit, faFacebook)

# Goal

The goal for this reporisity is to have a good and quick starting platform to develop websites with the latest versions of webpack 4, bootstrap 4 and font awesome 5. With not too complicated configurations.

# To-do list

I will add more features and updates when I have time. Contributors are more
then welcome.

* Add purgecss to minimize the outputted css file.
* Add some more useful demo content in index.html and index.js.
* Split the configuration for development and production using webpack-merge.
* Update this README.md. Maybe move some to doc files.
* Add ESLint for better debugging.
* Update the website.
* And a lot more…
